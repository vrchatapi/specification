    # Welcome to the VRChat API


    Before we begin, we would like to state this is a **COMMUNITY DRIVEN
    PROJECT**.

    This means that everything you read on here was written by the community
    itself and is **not** officially supported by VRChat.

    The documentation is provided "AS IS", and any action you take towards
    VRChat is completely your own responsibility.


    The documentation and additional libraries SHALL ONLY be used for
    applications interacting with VRChat's API in accordance

    with their [Terms of Service](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal) and [Community
    Guidelines](https://hello.vrchat.com/community-guidelines), and MUST NOT be
    used for modifying the client, "avatar ripping", or other illegal
    activities.

    Malicious usage or spamming the API may result in account termination.

    Certain parts of the API are also more sensitive than others, for example
    moderation, so please tread extra carefully and read the warnings when
    present.


    ![Tupper Policy on API](https://i.imgur.com/yLlW7Ok.png)


    Finally, use of the API using applications other than the approved methods
    (website, VRChat application, Unity SDK) is not officially supported.

    VRChat provides no guarantee or support for external applications using the
    API. Access to API endpoints may break **at any time, without notice**.

    Therefore, please **do not ping** VRChat Staff in the VRChat Discord if you
    are having API problems, as they do not provide API support.

    We will make a best effort in keeping this documentation and associated
    language libraries up to date, but things might be outdated or missing.

    If you find that something is no longer valid, please contact us on Discord
    or [create an issue](https://github.com/vrchatapi/specification/issues) and
    tell us so we can fix it.


    # Getting Started


    The VRChat API can be used to programmatically retrieve or update
    information regarding your profile, friends, avatars, worlds and more.

    The API consists of two parts, "Photon" which is only used in-game, and the
    "Web API" which is used by both the game and the website.

    This documentation focuses only on the Web API.


    The API is designed around the REST ideology, providing semi-simple and
    usually predictable URIs to access and modify objects.

    Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and
    standard status codes.

    Response bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly
    documented otherwise.


    <div class="callout callout-error">
      <strong>🛑 Warning! Do not touch Photon!</strong><br>
      Photon is only used by the in-game client and should <b>not</b> be touched. Doing so may result in permanent account termination.
    </div>


    <div class="callout callout-info">
      <strong>ℹ️ API Key and Authentication</strong><br>
      The API Key has always been the same and is currently <code>JlE5Jldo5Jibnk5O5hTx6XVqsJu4WJ26</code>.
      Read <a href="#tag--authentication">Authentication</a> for how to log in.
    </div>


    # Using the API


    For simply exploring what the API can do it is strongly recommended to
    download [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download), a free and open-source

    API client that's great for sending requests to the API in an orderly
    fashion.

    Insomnia allows you to send data in the format that's required for VRChat's
    API.

    It is also possible to try out the API in your browser, by first logging in
    at [vrchat.com/home](https://vrchat.com/home/) and then going to

    [vrchat.com/api/1/auth/user](https://vrchat.com/api/1/auth/user), but the
    information will be much harder to work with.


    For more permanent operation such as software development it is instead
    recommended to use one of the existing language SDKs.

    This community project maintains API libraries in several languages, which
    allows you to interact with the API with simple function calls

    rather than having to implement the HTTP protocol yourself. Most of these
    libraries are automatically generated from the API specification,

    sometimes with additional helpful wrapper code to make usage easier. This
    allows them to be almost automatically updated and expanded upon

    as soon as a new feature is introduced in the specification itself. The
    libraries can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/vrchatapi) or
    following:


    * [NodeJS (JavaScript)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vrchat)

    * [Dart](https://pub.dev/packages/vrchat_dart)

    * [Rust](https://crates.io/crates/vrchatapi)

    * [C#](https://github.com/vrchatapi/vrchatapi-csharp)

    * [Python](https://github.com/vrchatapi/VRChatPython)


    # Pagination


    Most endpoints enforce pagination, meaning they will only return 10 entries
    by default, and never more than 100.<br>

    Using both the limit and offset parameters allows you to easily paginate
    through a large number of objects.


    | Query Parameter | Type | Description |

    | ----------|--|------- |

    | `n` | integer  | The number of objects to return. This value often
    defaults to 10. Highest limit is always 100.|

    | `offset` | integer  | A zero-based offset from the default object
    sorting.|


    If a request returns fewer objects than the `limit` parameter, there are no
    more items available to return.


    # Contribution


    Do you want to get involved in the documentation effort? Do you want to help
    improve one of the language API libraries?

    This project is an [OPEN Open Source Project](https://openopensource.org)!
    This means that individuals making significant and valuable contributions
    are given

    commit-access to the project. It also means we are very open and welcoming
    of new people making contributions, unlike some more guarded open-source
    projects.

        Checks if a user by a given `username`, `displayName` or `email` exist.
        This is used during registration to check if a username has already been
        taken, during change of displayName to check if a displayName is
        available, and during change of email to check if the email is already
        used. In the later two cases the `excludeUserId` is used to exclude
        oneself, otherwise the result would always be true.


        It is **REQUIRED** to include **AT LEAST** `username`, `displayName`
        **or** `email` query parameter. Although they can be combined - in
        addition with `excludeUserId` (generally to exclude yourself) - to
        further fine-tune the search.

      description: >-
        This endpoint does the following two operations:
          1) Checks if you are already logged in by looking for a valid `auth` cookie. If you are have a valid auth cookie then no additional auth-related actions are taken. If you are **not** logged in then it will log you in with the `Authorization` header and set the `auth` cookie. The `auth` cookie will only be sent once.
          2) If logged in, this function will also return the CurrentUser object containing detailed information about the currently logged in user.

        **WARNING: Session Limit:** Each authentication with login credentials
        counts as a separate session, out of which you have a limited amount.
        Make sure to save and reuse the `auth` cookie if you are often
        restarting the program. The provided API libraries automatically save
        cookies during runtime, but does not persist during restart. While it
        can be fine to use username/password during development, expect in
        production to very fast run into the rate-limit and be temporarily
        blocked from making new sessions until older ones expire. The exact
        number of simultaneous sessions is unknown/undisclosed.

        Friend groups are named `group_0` through `group_3`. Avatar and World
        groups are named `avatars1` to `avatars4` and `worlds1` to `worlds4`.


        You cannot add people whom you are not friends with to your friends
        list. Destroying a friendship removes the person as favorite on both
        sides.

        Resetting a message respects the rate-limit, so it is not possible to
        reset within the 60 minutes countdown.

        Resetting it does however not set the rate-limit to 60 like when editing
        it.

        It is possible to edit it right after resetting it.

        IPS (Info Push System) is a system for VRChat to push out dynamic
        information to the client. This is primarily used by the Quick-Menu info
        banners, but can also be used to e.g. alert you to update your game to
        the latest version.


        `include` is used to query what Information Pushes should be included in
        the response. If include is missing or empty, then no notices will
        normally be returned. This is an "any of" search.


        `require` is used to limit what Information Pushes should be included in
        the response. This is usually used in combination with `include`, and is
        an "all of" search.

        Tags are a way to grant various access, assign restrictions or other

        avatars.


        System tags starting with `system_` are granted automatically by the
        system, while admin tags with `admin_` are granted manually. More
        prefixes such as `language_ ` (to indicate that a player can speak the
        tagged language), and `author_tag_` (provided by a world author for
        search and sorting) exist as well.
