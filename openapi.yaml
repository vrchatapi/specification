    # Welcome to the VRChat API

    Before we begin, we would like to state this is a **COMMUNITY DRIVEN PROJECT**.
    This means that everything you read on here was written by the community itself and is **not** officially supported by VRChat.
    The documentation is provided "AS IS", and any action you take towards VRChat is completely your own responsibility.

    The documentation and additional libraries SHALL ONLY be used for applications interacting with VRChat's API in accordance
    with their [Terms of Service](https://hello.vrchat.com/legal) and [Community Guidelines](https://hello.vrchat.com/community-guidelines), and MUST NOT be used for modifying the client, "avatar ripping", or other illegal activities.
    Malicious usage or spamming the API may result in account termination.
    Certain parts of the API are also more sensitive than others, for example moderation, so please tread extra carefully and read the warnings when present.

    ![Tupper Policy on API](https://i.imgur.com/yLlW7Ok.png)

    Finally, use of the API using applications other than the approved methods (website, VRChat application, Unity SDK) is not officially supported.
    VRChat provides no guarantee or support for external applications using the API. Access to API endpoints may break **at any time, without notice**.
    Therefore, please **do not ping** VRChat Staff in the VRChat Discord if you are having API problems, as they do not provide API support.
    We will make a best effort in keeping this documentation and associated language libraries up to date, but things might be outdated or missing.
    If you find that something is no longer valid, please contact us on Discord or [create an issue](https://github.com/vrchatapi/specification/issues) and tell us so we can fix it.

    # Getting Started

    The VRChat API can be used to programmatically retrieve or update information regarding your profile, friends, avatars, worlds and more.
    The API consists of two parts, "Photon" which is only used in-game, and the "Web API" which is used by both the game and the website.
    This documentation focuses only on the Web API.

    The API is designed around the REST ideology, providing semi-simple and usually predictable URIs to access and modify objects.
    Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes.
    Response bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise.

    <div class="callout callout-error">
      <strong>🛑 Warning! Do not touch Photon!</strong><br>
      Photon is only used by the in-game client and should <b>not</b> be touched. Doing so may result in permanent account termination.
    </div>

    <div class="callout callout-info">
      <strong>ℹ️ Authentication</strong><br>
      Read <a href="#tag--authentication">Authentication</a> for how to log in.
    </div>

    # Using the API

    For simply exploring what the API can do it is strongly recommended to download [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download), a free and open-source
    API client that's great for sending requests to the API in an orderly fashion.
    Insomnia allows you to send data in the format that's required for VRChat's API.
    It is also possible to try out the API in your browser, by first logging in at [vrchat.com/home](https://vrchat.com/home/) and then going to
    [vrchat.com/api/1/auth/user](https://vrchat.com/api/1/auth/user), but the information will be much harder to work with.

    For more permanent operation such as software development it is instead recommended to use one of the existing language SDKs.
    This community project maintains API libraries in several languages, which allows you to interact with the API with simple function calls
    rather than having to implement the HTTP protocol yourself. Most of these libraries are automatically generated from the API specification,
    sometimes with additional helpful wrapper code to make usage easier. This allows them to be almost automatically updated and expanded upon
    as soon as a new feature is introduced in the specification itself. The libraries can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/vrchatapi) or following:

    * [NodeJS (JavaScript)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vrchat)
    * [Dart](https://pub.dev/packages/vrchat_dart)
    * [Rust](https://crates.io/crates/vrchatapi)
    * [C#](https://github.com/vrchatapi/vrchatapi-csharp)
    * [Python](https://github.com/vrchatapi/vrchatapi-python)

    # Pagination

    Most endpoints enforce pagination, meaning they will only return 10 entries by default, and never more than 100.<br>
    Using both the limit and offset parameters allows you to easily paginate through a large number of objects.

    | Query Parameter | Type | Description |
    | ----------|--|------- |
    | `n` | integer  | The number of objects to return. This value often defaults to 10. Highest limit is always 100.|
    | `offset` | integer  | A zero-based offset from the default object sorting.|

    If a request returns fewer objects than the `limit` parameter, there are no more items available to return.

    # Contribution

    Do you want to get involved in the documentation effort? Do you want to help improve one of the language API libraries?
    This project is an [OPEN Open Source Project](https://openopensource.org)! This means that individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given
    commit-access to the project. It also means we are very open and welcoming of new people making contributions, unlike some more guarded open-source projects.

    description: |-
      There are two different moderation API's, "moderation" for Staff actions, and "playermoderation" for players.
      PlayerModerations are user-generated actions towards others, such as muting them, blocking, or toggling interaction.

      Your global permission settings are stored locally on your computer.
      Only player-specific moderations (when you target a player, and allow them specifically to interact with you) are stored in the API.

      ## Implementation details

      There are three different user-targetted permission options:

      - Mode 1: interactOn/unmute/unblock
      - Mode 2: interactOff/mute/block
      - *Default setting*

      **Example:**

      Force On (`interactOn`) and Force Off (`interactOff`) always or never allow that person to interact with you.
      These are stored as PlayerModerations. When you select a player and select "Force On", it creates a playerModeration of type `interactOn`.

      **Important order:**

      1. When switching between one mode from the other, e.g. "Force On" and "Force Off", **the previous playerModeration MUST first be deleted before creating the second.**
         The game sends these in sequence, first delete the old, then create the new. Attempting to create both `interactOn` and `interactOff` is UNDOCUMENTED behavior.
      2. "Use Current Setting" **does not have it's own enum**. The game removes any previous playerModeration of same type.
         No playerModeration of either type means fallback to the global setting.

      ## Deprecation notice

      As of October 2022, `showAvatar` and `hideAvatar` has been moved to local storage.
      Sending these types to the API will result in a 200 OK response, but the API will **not** store them.
      More information is avaiable on VRChat's official [documentation on Local Storage](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/local-vrchat-storage).

This is used during registration to check if a username has already been taken, during change of displayName to check if a displayName is available, and during change of email to check if the email is already used. In the later two cases the `excludeUserId` is used to exclude oneself, otherwise the result would always be true.

        It is **REQUIRED** to include **AT LEAST** `username`, `displayName` **or** `email` query parameter. Although they can be combined - in addition with `excludeUserId` (generally to exclude yourself) - to further fine-tune the search.

      summary: Login and/or Get Current User Info
      description: |-
        This endpoint does the following two operations:
          1) Checks if you are already logged in by looking for a valid `auth` cookie. If you are have a valid auth cookie then no additional auth-related actions are taken. If you are **not** logged in then it will log you in with the `Authorization` header and set the `auth` cookie. The `auth` cookie will only be sent once.
          2) If logged in, this function will also return the CurrentUser object containing detailed information about the currently logged in user.

        The auth string after `Authorization: Basic {string}` is a base64-encoded string of the username and password, both individually url-encoded, and then joined with a colon.

        > base64(urlencode(username):urlencode(password))

        **WARNING: Session Limit:** Each authentication with login credentials counts as a separate session, out of which you have a limited amount. Make sure to save and reuse the `auth` cookie if you are often restarting the program. The provided API libraries automatically save cookies during runtime, but does not persist during restart. While it can be fine to use username/password during development, expect in production to very fast run into the rate-limit and be temporarily blocked from making new sessions until older ones expire. The exact number of simultaneous sessions is unknown/undisclosed.

        Friend groups are named `group_0` through `group_3`. Avatar and World groups are named `avatars1` to `avatars4` and `worlds1` to `worlds4`.

        You cannot add people whom you are not friends with to your friends list. Destroying a friendship removes the person as favorite on both sides.

        IPS (Info Push System) is a system for VRChat to push out dynamic information to the client. This is primarily used by the Quick-Menu info banners, but can also be used to e.g. alert you to update your game to the latest version.

        `include` is used to query what Information Pushes should be included in the response. If include is missing or empty, then no notices will normally be returned. This is an "any of" search.

        `require` is used to limit what Information Pushes should be included in the response. This is usually used in combination with `include`, and is an "all of" search.

        Tags are a way to grant various access, assign restrictions or other kinds of metadata to various to objects such as worlds, users and avatars.

        System tags starting with `system_` are granted automatically by the system, while admin tags with `admin_` are granted manually. More prefixes such as `language_ ` (to indicate that a player can speak the tagged language), and `author_tag_` (provided by a world author for search and sorting) exist as well.
