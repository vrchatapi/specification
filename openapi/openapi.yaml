Access to API endpoints may break **at any time, without notice**.\nTherefore, please **do not ping** VRChat Staff in the VRChat Discord if you are having API problems, as they do not provide API support.\nWe will make a best effort in keeping this documentation and associated language libraries up to date, but things might be outdated or missing.\nIf you find that something is no longer valid, please contact us on Discord or [create an issue](https://github.com/vrchatapi/specification/issues) and tell us so we can fix it.\n\n# Getting Started\n\nThe VRChat API can be used to programmatically retrieve or update information regarding your profile, friends, avatars, worlds and more.\nThe API consists of two parts, \"Photon\" which is only used in-game, and the \"Web API\" which is used by both the game and the website.\nThis documentation focuses only on the Web API.\n\nThe API is designed around the REST ideology, providing semi-simple and usually predictable URIs to access and modify objects.\nRequests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes.\nResponse bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise.\n\n<div class=\"callout callout-error\">\n  <strong>\U0001F6D1 Warning! Do not touch Photon!</strong><br>\n  Photon is only used by the in-game client and should <b>not</b> be touched. Doing so may result in permanent account termination.\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"callout callout-info\">\n  <strong>ℹ️ Authentication</strong><br>\n  Read <a href=\"#tag--authentication\">Authentication</a> for how to log in.\n</div>\n\n# Using the API\n\nFor simply exploring what the API can do it is strongly recommended to download [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download), a free and open-source\nAPI client that's great for sending requests to the API in an orderly fashion.\nInsomnia allows you to send data in the format that's required for VRChat's API.\nIt is also possible to try out the API in your browser, by first logging in at [vrchat.com/home](https://vrchat.com/home/) and then going to\n[vrchat.com/api/1/auth/user](https://vrchat.com/api/1/auth/user), but the information will be much harder to work with.\n\nFor more permanent operation such as software development it is instead recommended to use one of the existing language SDKs.\nThis community project maintains API libraries in several languages, which allows you to interact with the API with simple function calls\nrather than having to implement the HTTP protocol yourself. Most of these libraries are automatically generated from the API specification,\nsometimes with additional helpful wrapper code to make usage easier. This allows them to be almost automatically updated and expanded upon\nas soon as a new feature is introduced in the specification itself. The libraries can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/vrchatapi) or following:\n\n* [NodeJS (JavaScript)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vrchat)\n* [Dart](https://pub.dev/packages/vrchat_dart)\n* [Rust](https://crates.io/crates/vrchatapi)\n* [C#](https://github.com/vrchatapi/vrchatapi-csharp)\n* [Python](https://github.com/vrchatapi/vrchatapi-python)\n\n# Pagination\n\nMost endpoints enforce pagination, meaning they will only return 10 entries by default, and never more than 100.<br>\nUsing both the limit and offset parameters allows you to easily paginate through a large number of objects.\n\n| Query Parameter | Type | Description |\n| ----------|--|------- |\n| `n` | integer  | The number of objects to return. This value often defaults to 10. Highest limit is always 100.|\n| `offset` | integer  | A zero-based offset from the default object sorting.|\n\nIf a request returns fewer objects than the `limit` parameter, there are no more items available to return.\n\n# Contribution\n\nDo you want to get involved in the documentation effort? Do you want to help improve one of the language API libraries?\nThis project is an [OPEN Open Source Project](https://openopensource.org)! This means that individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given\ncommit-access to the project. It also means we are very open and welcoming of new people making contributions, unlike some more guarded open-source projects.\n\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=vrchatapi&message=discord&color=blueviolet&style=for-the-badge)](https://discord.gg/qjZE9C9fkB)"
