    There are two different moderation API's, "moderation" for Staff actions, and "playermoderation" for players. PlayerModeration's are user-generated actions towards others, such as muting them, blocking, or hiding their avatar.

    Player moderations are also used for other things, such as in the Avatar Dynamics Interaction system.
    Permissions which affect globally are stored in a Registry key locally on your computer, but player-specific moderations (when you target a player, and allow them specifically to interact with you) is stored in the API.

    There are three different user-targeted permission options:

    - Force On
    - Force Off
    - User Current Setting

    Force On a.k.a `interactOn` and Force Off `interactOff` always or never allow that person to interact with you. These are stored as PlayerModeration's. When you select a player and select "Force On", it creates a playerModeration of type `interactOn`.

    ## Two important implementation details:

    1. When switching between "Force On" and "Force Off", **the previous playerModeration MUST first be deleted before creating the second one.** The game sends these in sequence, first delete the old, then create the new. Attempting to create both `interactOn` and `interactOff` is UNDOCUMENTED behavior.
    2. "Use Current Setting" **does not have it's own type**. It simply removes the previous playerModeration. No playerModeration of either type means fallback to the global setting.
