    There are two different moderation API's, "moderation" for Staff actions, and "playermoderation" for players.
    PlayerModerations are user-generated actions towards others, such as muting them, blocking, or toggling interaction.

    Your global permission settings are stored locally on your computer.
    Only player-specific moderations (when you target a player, and allow them specifically to interact with you) are stored in the API.

    ## Implementation details

    There are three different user-targetted permission options:

    - Mode 1: interactOn/unmute/unblock
    - Mode 2: interactOff/mute/unblock
    - *Default setting*

    **Example:**
    
    Force On (`interactOn`) and Force Off (`interactOff`) always or never allow that person to interact with you.
    These are stored as PlayerModerations. When you select a player and select "Force On", it creates a playerModeration of type `interactOn`.

    **Important order:**

    1. When switching between one mode from the other, e.g. "Force On" and "Force Off", **the previous playerModeration MUST first be deleted before creating the second.**
       The game sends these in sequence, first delete the old, then create the new. Attempting to create both `interactOn` and `interactOff` is UNDOCUMENTED behavior.
    2. "Use Current Setting" **does not have it's own enum**. The game removes any previous playerModeration of same type.
       No playerModeration of either type means fallback to the global setting.

    ## Deprecation notice

    As of October 2022, `showAvatar` and `hideAvatar` has been moved to local storage.
    Sending these types to the API will result in a 200 OK response, but the API will **not** store them.
    More information is avaiable on VRChat's official [documentation on Local Storage](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/local-vrchat-storage).
